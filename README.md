# Stochastic-gradient algorithms
Matlab implementations of LMS, normalized LMS and RLS stochastic-gradient algorithms. Functions return the learning curves of each method, but can be easily modified to return the estimated result. Accompanies Matlab script to plot the ensamble-average learning curves.
